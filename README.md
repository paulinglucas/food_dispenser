# food_dispenser

This script is used to turn a dc motor with the intent of pouring food into my dogs bowl.

NAME_OF_DOG is constant, using my dog's name Ollie.

I use the crontab to automatically run this script twice every day, once at 9 am and again at 5 pm.

Now my parents no longer have to make stops home to feed the dog!
